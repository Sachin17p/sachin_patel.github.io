		<h1>About Sachin Patel</h1>
		<p>Sachin is currently working at the Materials Design Lab in the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at IIT Madras.<br>
			DFT-assisted calculations are employed using the VASP code to investigate the impact of vibrational entropy on the <br>thermal stability of various 
			refractory alloys. Our research aims to provide insight into the fundamental properties of materials at the atomic scale, <br>with the ultimate goal
			of developing advanced materials for various industrial applications. Apart from that, he is a part of <br>the institute cricket team (IIT Madras), which 
			implies that he is fond of the game and very athletic.</p>
